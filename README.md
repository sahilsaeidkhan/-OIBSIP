Project Collection README
Welcome to my project collection! This repository contains several projects that showcase my journey and learning process in web development, leveraging both traditional problem-solving and modern AI assistance. Below, Iâ€™ll share an overview of each project and some reflections on my experiences and thought process while building them.

ðŸ“‚ Project List
Level 1 - Task 1: Landing Page
A simple landing page demonstrating HTML, CSS, and basic design skills.

Level 1 - Task 2: Portfolio
An interactive personal portfolio site, designed to highlight my skills, projects, and resume, using responsive design techniques.

Level 1 - Task 3: Temperature Converter
A straightforward utility app for converting temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This involved logic building with basic JavaScript.

Level 2 - Task 1: Calculator
A fully functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, handling user input and multiple operations with a clean UI.

ðŸŸ¢ My Approach & Reflections
When I first set out to tackle these projects, I expected the process to be quite hectic and time-consuming. However, by leveraging advanced AI tools like Perplexity Pro, Gemini Pro, Claude Pro, and ChatGPT Pro, the entire experience was transformed. These AI assistants acted like personal teachers, available 24/7 to answer my questions, explain concepts, and even help debug tricky code.

I was particularly amazed by Claudeâ€”it's truly impressive in its reasoning and ability to break down complex topics into understandable steps. This made learning both faster and a lot more enjoyable. As a result, what could have been a daunting set of tasks turned into an engaging, insightful, and highly productive learning journey.

ðŸ¤– The Future of Development
Through this experience, I realized that the landscape for frontend developers is rapidly evolving. With such powerful AI tools at our fingertips, many of the traditional challenges in development are being simplifiedâ€”or even automated. I genuinely believe that frontend developers who rely only on basic skills might soon find themselves replaced, unless they adapt and embrace these new technologies to scale their creativity and productivity.

ðŸš€ Conclusion
The projects in this repository represent not just code, but a story of growthâ€”enabled by both my willingness to learn and the transformative power of AI. If youâ€™re starting out on your own journey, I highly recommend exploring these AI toolsâ€”they truly make the learning curve much more approachable and exciting.
